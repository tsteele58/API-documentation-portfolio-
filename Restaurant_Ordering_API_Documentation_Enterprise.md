# Restaurant Ordering API Documentation (Enterprise SaaS Edition)

## Overview
The Restaurant Ordering API is part of a simulated enterprise-grade, cloud-based SaaS platform designed for multi-location restaurants and food service providers. 
This API allows authenticated restaurant partners to integrate their digital menus, process orders, and track fulfillment in real-time. 
It supports multi-tenant environments with secure tenant isolation and developer-friendly documentation aligned with OpenAPI best practices.

## Key SaaS Features
- Multi-tenant architecture (each restaurant is scoped via Tenant ID)
- Scalable cloud infrastructure for high-volume ordering systems
- Webhook support for real-time event notifications
- Self-service API key management through a developer portal
- Versioned API for backward compatibility and long-term support

## Authentication
All requests must include a valid API key and Tenant ID in the headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
X-Tenant-ID: restaurant_123
```

## Base URL (Versioned)
```
https://api.restaurantcloud.com/v1
```
